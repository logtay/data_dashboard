# Web Development Project 6 - *Data Dashboard Pt. 2*

Submitted by: **Taylor Femat**

This web app: **Uses the Spotify Web API to fetch information about the rock band Arctic Monkeys. It provides them with a listing of released tracks, which they can filter or click on to view further details such as track duration and track popularity. On the main page, they can also view visualizations of the data. There is an About Page included that tells the user a bit more about where the data comes from and how they might interpret it.**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total
